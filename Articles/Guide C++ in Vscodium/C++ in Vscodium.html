            <h1>Guide : C++ in Vscodium (on Windows)</h1>

            This article serves more as a note-to-self if anything. In case I ever want to replicate my current setup, I will have a list of resources here to look back on.
            
            I wanted to set up vscodium in a way that allows me to write and run c++, specifically for writing opengl code. This took more effort that I at first anticipated. The (somewhat janky) setup that I ended up using was a combination of premake and clangd.
