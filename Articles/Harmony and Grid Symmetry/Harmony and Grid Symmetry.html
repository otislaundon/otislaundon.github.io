            <h2>Motivation</h2>
            <p>
                This idea came about when I messing about with raymarching, where it is easy to render an infinitely repeating grid of objects, and I noticed that these geometric paterns emerged that seemed to line up with directions that had a simple ratio of x:y:z. You know what else kind of corresponds to simple ratios? Musical harmony!

            <p>
                In this article I aim to show you that the patterns you see in the image above correspond in some way to musical chords. The key point here is that both come from simple ratios of integers. 
            </p>

            <h2>Musical intervals</h2>
            <p>
                In music, a gross oversimplification is to say that intervals with a simple ratio of frequencies sound consonant, whilst less simple ratios tend to sound more dissonant. For example, a perfect 5th is a very consonant sounding interval and has frequency ratio 2:3. On the other hand, something like a tritone has frequency ratio 32:45. You can compare the 2 sounds below.

            <h2>Symmetric patterns</h2>

            <h2>Ratios of vector components</h2>
